# Networking Architecture with Terraform

![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-Completed-brightgreen)

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a **secure cloud network architecture** on AWS using **Terraform**. It focuses on foundational cloud networking principles and best practices, including:

- Creating isolated network environments
- Managing secure access
- Automating infrastructure with Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

The goal is to gain practical experience with AWS networking and Terraform, while building a clean, professional cloud setup for learning and portfolio purposes.

## ðŸ§± Architecture Overview

This network is designed from the ground up using **Terraform**, ensuring consistent, repeatable infrastructure deployment.

### Key Components

- **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** â€“ Private network for AWS resources  
- **Subnets** â€“ Divided into public and private zones  
- **Internet Gateway** â€“ Enables internet access for public subnets  
- **Route Tables** â€“ Manages traffic routing within the network  
- **Security Groups** â€“ Controls traffic with virtual firewalls

## ðŸ§  Key Learning Objectives

- Practice **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** using Terraform  
- Understand core AWS **networking components**  
- Implement **segmentation and access control**  
- Develop repeatable, scalable network deployments  

---

## âœ… Outcome

This project results in a **secure, modular AWS network architecture** fully deployed via Terraform. Itâ€™s suitable for cloud workloads, extension into full-stack environments, or showcasing Terraform proficiency.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Notes
All infrastructure was deployed using Terraform CLI.
AWS resources have been validated and cleaned up post-deployment.
Project tested in eu-north-1, Terraform v1.13.3.
