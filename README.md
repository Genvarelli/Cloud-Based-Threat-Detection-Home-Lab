# Secure Cloud Environment on AWS  

![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-In%20Development-yellow)

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to build a **secure, resilient cloud environment** on AWS.  
It focuses on **best practices** for network design, identity management, data protection, and monitoring.  

The goal is to create an environment that is **secure by design** while providing a clear example for learning and portfolio purposes.

**High-level objectives:**
- Separate network zones for public and private resources
- Secure access with least-privilege IAM policies
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
- Enable auditing, monitoring, and threat detection
- Set up alerts for security events

> Non-technical summary: We’re creating a “safe, monitored home” for cloud resources, making sure everything is protected, watched, and controlled.

## 🛠 Skills Demonstrated
- Designing **VPCs** with public/private subnets and NAT gateways
- Configuring **IAM roles** and least-privilege policies
- Encrypting data at rest (**S3 + KMS**) and in transit (**ACM + HTTPS**)
- Enabling **CloudTrail**, **AWS Config**, and **GuardDuty** for auditing and threat detection
- Creating **SNS** and **EventBridge** alerts for security events

## 📌 Implementation Steps
1. **Networking Setup** – Build VPC with public/private subnets and NAT gateway  
2. **IAM Configuration** – Create roles and policies following least-privilege principles  
3. **Data Protection** – Enable encryption for S3 buckets and configure HTTPS using ACM  
4. **Monitoring & Alerts** – Activate CloudTrail, Config, and GuardDuty; set up SNS/EventBridge notifications
