# Secure AWS Networking with Terraform

![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-In%20Development-yellow)

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a **secure cloud network architecture** on AWS using **Terraform**. It focuses on foundational cloud networking principles and best practices, including:

- Creating isolated network environments
- Managing secure access
- Automating infrastructure with Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

The goal is to gain practical experience with AWS networking and Terraform, while building a clean, professional cloud setup for learning and portfolio purposes.

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

This network is designed from the ground up using **Terraform**, ensuring consistent, repeatable infrastructure deployment.

### Key Components

- **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)**  
  Creates a private network where all AWS resources reside.

- **Subnets**  
  Divides the network into **public** and **private** zones.

- **Internet Gateway**  
  Enables external communication for public resources.

- **Route Tables**  
  Directs traffic flow between subnets and external networks.

- **Security Groups**  
  Acts as virtual firewalls for controlling inbound and outbound traffic.

## 🧠 Key Learning Objectives

- Practice **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** using Terraform
- Understand core AWS **networking components**
- Implement **segmentation and access control** using best practices
- Develop repeatable, scalable network deployments
