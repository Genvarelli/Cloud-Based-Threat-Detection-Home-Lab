# Secure Cloud Environment on AWS  
![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-In%20Development-yellow)

## 🚀 Project Overview  
This project focuses on building a **secure cloud environment** on **AWS**.  
It demonstrates best practices in **IAM, networking, logging, monitoring, and encryption** to create a compliant and resilient cloud architecture.

---

## 🛠 Skills Demonstrated  
- Designing **VPCs with public/private subnets and NAT gateways**  
- Configuring **IAM roles and least-privilege policies**  
- Encrypting data **at rest** (S3 + KMS) and **in transit** (ACM + HTTPS)  
- Enabling **CloudTrail, Config, GuardDuty** for auditing and threat detection  
- Creating **SNS and EventBridge alerts** for security events  

---

## ☁️ AWS Services Used  
- **VPC, Subnets, NAT Gateway** – Network segmentation  
- **IAM** – Roles and policies  
- **S3 + KMS** – Encrypted storage  
- **ACM + HTTPS** – TLS certificates for encrypted communication  
- **CloudTrail** – API activity logging  
- **AWS Config** – Compliance monitoring  
- **GuardDuty** – Threat detection  
- **SNS + EventBridge** – Event notifications and alerts  

---

## 📌 Implementation Steps  
1. **Networking Setup** – Build VPC with public/private subnets and NAT gateway  
2. **IAM Configuration** – Create roles and policies following least-privilege principles  
3. **Data Protection** – Enable encryption for S3 buckets and configure HTTPS using ACM  
4. **Monitoring & Alerts** – Activate CloudTrail, Config, and GuardDuty; set up SNS/EventBridge notifications  

---

## ⚡ Key Takeaways  
- Practical experience in **secure AWS architecture design**  
- Applied **defense-in-depth principles** for cloud workloads  
- Learned to **proactively monitor, detect, and respond** to security events  

---

## 📝 Next Steps (In Progress)  
- Implement automated remediation for security alerts  
- Expand monitoring coverage with **CloudWatch dashboards**  
- Integrate additional compliance checks and logging sources
